                  holds the same fields as ForProvider, with the exception of Identifier

                  are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created. The same
                  fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to avoid
                  updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after
                  creation, for example because of an external controller is managing
                  them, like an autoscaler.
